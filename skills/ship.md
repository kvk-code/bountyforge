# Ship a dApp

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**You jump to code without a plan.** Before writing a single line of Solidity, you need to know: what goes onchain, what stays offchain, which chain, how many contracts, and who calls every function. Skip this and you'll rewrite everything.

**You over-engineer.** Most dApps need 0-2 contracts. A token launch is 1 contract. An NFT collection is 1 contract. A marketplace that uses existing DEX liquidity needs 0 contracts. Three contracts is the upper bound for an MVP. If you're writing more, you're building too much.

**You put too much onchain.** Solidity is for ownership, transfers, and commitments. It's not a database. It's not an API. It's not a backend. If it doesn't involve trustless value transfer or a permanent commitment, it doesn't belong in a smart contract.

**You skip chain selection.** Mainnet is cheaper than you think — an ETH transfer costs ~$0.004, a swap ~$0.04. The "Ethereum is expensive" narrative is outdated. But that doesn't mean everything belongs on mainnet. L2s aren't just "cheaper Ethereum" — each one has a unique superpower (Base has Coinbase distribution + smart wallets, Arbitrum has the deepest DeFi liquidity, Optimism has retroPGF + the Superchain). If your app needs high-frequency interactions or fits what makes an L2 special, build there. If you just need cheap and secure, mainnet works. Choose deliberately.

**You forget nothing is automatic.** Smart contracts don't run themselves. Every state transition needs a caller who pays gas and a reason to do it. If you can't answer "who calls this and why?" for every function, your contract has dead code.

## Phase 0 — Plan the Architecture

Do this BEFORE writing any code. Every hour spent here saves ten hours of rewrites.

### The Onchain Litmus Test

Put it onchain if it involves:
- **Trustless ownership** — who owns this token/NFT/position?
- **Trustless exchange** — swapping, trading, lending, borrowing
- **Composability** — other contracts need to call it
- **Censorship resistance** — must work even if your team disappears
- **Permanent commitments** — votes, attestations, proofs

Keep it offchain if it involves:
- User profiles, preferences, settings
- Search, filtering, sorting
- Images, videos, metadata (store on IPFS, reference onchain)
- Business logic that changes frequently
- Anything that doesn't involve value transfer or trust

### MVP Contract Count

| What you're building | Contracts | Pattern |
|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| Token launch | 1 | ERC-20 with custom logic |
| NFT collection | 1 | ERC-721 with mint/metadata |
| Simple marketplace | 0-1 | Use existing DEX; maybe a listing contract |
| Vault / yield | 1 | ERC-4626 vault |
| Lending protocol | 1-2 | Pool + oracle integration |
| DAO / governance | 1-3 | Governor + token + timelock |
| AI agent service | 0-1 | Maybe an ERC-8004 registration |
| Prediction market | 1-2 | Market + resolution oracle |

**If you need more than 3 contracts for an MVP, you're over-building.**

### State Transition Audit

For EVERY function in your contract, fill in this worksheet:

```
Function: ____________
Who calls it? ____________
Why would they? ____________
What if nobody calls it? ____________
Does it need gas incentives? ____________
```

## dApp Archetype: AI Agent Service (0-1 contracts)

**Architecture:** Agent logic is offchain. Onchain component is optional — ERC-8004 identity registration, or a payment contract for x402.

**Contracts:**
- (often none — agent runs offchain, uses existing payment infra)
- `AgentRegistry.sol` (optional) — ERC-8004 identity + service endpoints

**Common mistakes:**
- Putting agent logic onchain (Solidity is not for AI inference)
- Overcomplicating payments (x402 handles HTTP-native payments)
- Ignoring key management

---

## Phase 1 — Build Contracts

Key guidance:
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts as your base — don't reinvent ERC-20, ERC-721, or AccessControl
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern for every external call
- Emit events for every state change (your frontend and indexer need them)
- Use `SafeERC20` for all token operations
- Run through the security checklist before moving to Phase 2

---

## Phase 2 — Test

Don't skip this. Don't "test later." Test before deploy.

Key guidance:
- Unit test every custom function (not OpenZeppelin internals)
- Fuzz test all math operations — fuzzing finds the bugs you didn't think of
- Fork test any integration with external protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
- Run `slither .` for static analysis before deploying
- Target edge cases: zero amounts, max uint, empty arrays, self-transfers, unauthorized callers

---

## Phase 3 — Build Frontend

Key guidance:
- Show loading states on every async operation (blockchains take 5-12 seconds)
- Display token amounts in human-readable form with `formatEther`/`formatUnits`
- Never use infinite approvals

---

## Phase 4 — Ship to Production

### Contract Deployment
1. Set gas settings appropriate for the target chain
2. Deploy and verify contracts on block explorer
3. Transfer ownership to a multisig (Gnosis Safe) — never leave a single EOA as owner in production
4. Post-deploy checks: call every read function, verify state, test one small transaction

## Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] Identify what goes onchain vs offchain (use the Litmus Test above)
- [ ] Count your contracts (aim for 1-2 for MVP)
- [ ] Pick your chain (mainnet is cheap now — pick an L2 only if its superpower fits your app)
- [ ] Audit every state transition (who calls it? why?)
- [ ] Write contracts using OpenZeppelin base contracts
- [ ] Test with Foundry (unit + fuzz + fork tests)
- [ ] Deploy, verify, transfer ownership to multisig
- [ ] Ship frontend
